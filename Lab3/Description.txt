The parser reads the list of separators, reserved words and operators from a line named, token.in. 
It reads these into arrays and then when parses it will reference them.
The source file is firstly separated by lines in order to help the user in case there is an error.
After that, the scanning is done sort of character by character, with a special case. In case we detect
the start of a string, we parsed everything until the end of the string as a single token. If there is
no separator, then the token will be left as it is.
